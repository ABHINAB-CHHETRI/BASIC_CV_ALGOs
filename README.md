# Basic Image Processing

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x200?text=Basic+Image+Processing)

## Overview

This project contains a curated collection of resources and notes based on a comprehensive "Basic Image Processing" lecture series, covering fundamental concepts in digital image manipulation and analysis. The materials are derived from a detailed reference PDF (e.g., a 180+ page lecture note) and include step-by-step explanations of image representation, spatial filtering, frequency transforms, and more. This repository is intended as a practical study aid for mastering how images are processed and interpreted at a foundational level.

## Features

- Thorough notes on essential image processing topics
- Visual aids and sample images derived from the original reference PDF
- Clearly organized sections for quick access
- Useful for exam preparation and self-learning

## Usage

- Review PDF slides or notes for deep dives into each topic.
- Use section headings (e.g., Image Representation, Filtering) to navigate.
- Study flowcharts, sample code, and visual examples for intuitive learning.

## Topics Covered

The material includes the following major areas:

- **Digital Image Representation and Properties**
- **Image Enhancement in Spatial Domain**
- **Image Enhancement in Frequency Domain**
- **Image Segmentation Techniques**
- **Image Restoration and Noise Reduction**
- **Morphological Image Processing**
- **Edge Detection and Feature Extraction**
- **Applications of Image Processing**

Every section has concise definitions, sample code (Python, MATLAB), practical tips, and annotated diagrams illustrating key principles like convolution, edge detection, and color transformation.

## Contributing
